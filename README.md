PREDICT THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON AGRICULTURE AND SEA LEVEL

#Introduction
1) Climate change is expected to have significant impacts on both agriculture and sea levels. In agriculture, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns will likely disrupt growing seasons, reduce crop yields, and increase the prevalence of pests and diseases. This could lead to food shortages, higher prices, and economic instability in regions reliant on agriculture.

2) Sea level rise, driven by melting ice caps and thermal expansion of seawater, threatens coastal communities and infrastructure. Higher sea levels increase the risk of flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources, affecting agriculture, drinking water supplies, and biodiversity. Mitigating these impacts requires urgent global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the changing climate.


#Abstract

1) This project examines how climate change will affect farming and sea levels. Climate change is causing shifts in temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather, which can harm crops and make farming harder. Additionally, the melting of polar ice caps is causing sea levels to rise, leading to more flooding and erosion along coastlines.

2) By visually representing these complex phenomena, this project aims to facilitate comprehension of the challenges posed by climate change on agriculture and coastal regions. Through graphical outputs, we seek to convey the urgency of implementing adaptation strategies and mitigation measures to safeguard food security and coastal communities in the face of climate change.
